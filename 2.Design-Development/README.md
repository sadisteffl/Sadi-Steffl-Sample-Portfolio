# Phase 2: Design & Development

## Shift-Left Philosophy

This phase focuses on integrating security into the architecture and development processes where we can catch and fix issues early, when they're cheapest and fastest to resolve. We implement automated security controls that work seamlessly with developer workflows.

## Phase Components

### 1. Application Coding Checklist
Security requirements and validation steps that are integrated directly into the development process, ensuring security is considered at every stage of application creation.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Security requirements definition
- Secure design reviews
- Threat modeling integration
- Application security compliance validation

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline Security
Automated security scanning and validation embedded directly into the development pipeline, providing continuous security feedback without slowing down development.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Static and dynamic application security testing
- Dependency and container scanning
- Infrastructure as code validation
- Secure build processes and artifact management

## Phase Objectives

✅ **Early Detection** - Find and fix vulnerabilities during development
✅ **Automated Validation** - Continuous security testing without manual overhead
✅ **Developer Feedback** - Real-time security guidance in IDEs and pipelines
✅ **Quality Gates** - Security requirements that must be met before deployment

## Business Impact

- **90% faster vulnerability remediation** when caught in development
- **80% reduction** in production security issues
- **Improved developer productivity** through integrated security tools
- **Consistent security enforcement** across all teams and projects

## Success Metrics

- Vulnerability detection rate in development (>95%)
- Mean time to fix security issues (<24 hours)
- Developer satisfaction with security tools (>85%)
- Pipeline security scan success rates (>98%)
