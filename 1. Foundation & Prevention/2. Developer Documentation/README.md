# Developer Documentation Standards

## Introduction

This repository and the internal developer portal serve as the single source of truth for all engineering standards, covering both application development and infrastructure management.

## The Importance of Our Internal Developer Standards

Posting and maintaining these standards is critical for several key reasons:

1. Ensuring Consistency and Quality: When everyone follows the same playbook, it builds a more cohesive, predictable, and high-quality product. It eliminates ambiguity and ensures that best practices are applied uniformly across all teams.

2. Accelerating Onboarding and Development: New engineers can become productive significantly faster when they have a clear, centralized resource that outlines the technology stack, coding patterns, security requirements, and deployment processes.

3. Embedding Security and Compliance: Documented standards are not optional - they are a core part of the security program. They make security a shared responsibility and are essential for proving compliance with frameworks like SOC 2 and ISO 27001 to auditors and customers.

4. Driving Autonomy and Innovation: Clear standards empower engineers. By understanding the established "guardrails," you have the freedom to innovate and make decisions confidently without needing constant oversight, knowing your work aligns with the company's technical and security vision.

This centralized documentation is a living resource. Security encourages you to engage with it, suggest improvements, and help us maintain a culture of engineering excellence.
