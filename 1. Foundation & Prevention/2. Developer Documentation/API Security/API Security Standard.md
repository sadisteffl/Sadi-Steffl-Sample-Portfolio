# API Security Standard

This document defines the security requirements and best practices for designing, developing, and deploying APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). APIs are critical components of modern applications and require comprehensive security controls to protect against unauthorized access, data breaches, and service disruption.

## Scope

This standard applies to:
- RESTful APIs (HTTP/HTTPS)
- GraphQL APIs
- gRPC APIs
- Internal and external APIs
- API gateways and management platforms
- Third-party API integrations
