This document outlines the security requirements and best practices for developing, deploying, and managing containerized applications. Containers provide numerous benefits for application deployment but introduce unique security considerations that must be addressed throughout the container lifecycle.

## Scope

This standard applies to:
- Docker containers and images
- Container runtime environments
- Container registries and repositories
- Container orchestration platforms (excluding Kubernetes-specific requirements covered in separate standards)
- Development workflows involving containers

## Container Image Security

### Image Building Standards

| Control ID | Severity | Requirement | Description | Implementation Guidance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| IMG-01 | Critical | Use Minimal Base Images | Start with minimal, security-focused base images (distroless, Alpine, or official vendor images) | Prefer `distroless` or `scratch` images for production. Use official images when available. |
| IMG-02 | Critical | Non-Root User | Containers must run as non-root users with minimal privileges | Add `USER` directive in Dockerfile. Create specific user with limited permissions. |
| IMG-03 | High | Multi-Stage Builds | Use multi-stage builds to eliminate build-time dependencies from final image | Separate build and runtime environments. Copy only necessary artifacts. |
| IMG-04 | High | Immutable Tags | Use specific image tags (avoid `latest`, `develop`, `master`) | Implement semantic versioning or commit SHA tags. Document version lifecycle. |
| IMG-05 | High | Image Signing | Sign all production images using container image signing tools | Use Cosign, Notary, or cloud provider signing services. Verify signatures before deployment. |
