# Database Security Standard

This document outlines the security requirements and best practices for designing, implementing, and managing database systems. Databases are critical assets that store sensitive information and require comprehensive security controls to protect against unauthorized access, data breaches, and service disruption.

## Scope

This standard applies to:
- Relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle)
- NoSQL databases (MongoDB, DynamoDB, Cassandra, Redis)
- Database management systems and tools
- Database backup and recovery systems
- Database monitoring and auditing systems
